# Introduction

## What is an Operating System?
	- is a software that runs in kernel mode
	- it performs two things
		- providing application programmer a clean abstract set of resources
		- manage these hardware resources

## Resource Management
	- it includes multiplexing(sharing) resources in two different ways:
		- time
			- different programs take turn using CPU
		- space
			- different programs take part of the resource



## Processors
	- CPU is the brain. it has three basic cycle: fetch from memory, decode its type and operands, execute it. 
	- CPU have its own memory because accessing memory takes much longer than executing. so, all CPUs contain registers. 
	- Registers
		- hold variables and temporary result
		- Special Registers
			- Program counter: contains the memory address of next instruction
